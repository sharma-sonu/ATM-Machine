# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Java-based ATM Machine Simulation that provides users with a realistic banking experience. It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizes Swing for a graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to authenticate, check their balance, withdraw and deposit cash, and track transactions in a simulated environment.

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 Secure user authentication with PIN verification
- 💰 Account balance inquiry
- 💵 Cash withdrawal and deposit functionality
- 📝 Transaction history tracking
- 🖥️ Intuitive and user-friendly Swing-based GUI
- ⚠️ Error handling for invalid inputs and transactions
- 🔄 Simulation of bank transactions with real-world constraints

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- ☕ Java (Core Java, OOP principles)
- 🖥️ Swing (Graphical User Interface)
- 🗃️ File Handling (for data storage and retrieval)
- 🔄 Exception Handling

## 🚀 Installation
